It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. Its prototype is the following:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Where **format** hsyshdyd xixjjdidcontains the string that is printed. As *_printf()* is variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.

The format tags prototype is the following:

	%[flags][length]specifier
